## 🛠️ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get your own copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3 and `pip` installed on your system.

### Installation

1.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd /path/to/your/app/
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

    *On macOS/Linux:*
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

    *On Windows:*
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    .\.venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install the dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Apply database migrations:**
    This will set up the database schema for our `Task` model.
    ```bash
    python manage.py makemigrations tasks
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

5.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

    Now, open your favorite web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/tasks/` to see the app in action! 🥳

## 🧪 Running Tests

We have a suite of tests to ensure the core functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete) works correctly. To run the tests, execute the following command:
